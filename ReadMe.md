# Jakarta CLI

Jakarta CLI is a command line interface for interacting with the file system.

## Usage

```bash
java -jar jakarta-cli.jar
``` 
In assistance of the command line interface, you can use the following commands:
- `help`: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `exit`: Exit the application.
- `pwd`: Print the current working directory.
- `cd`: Change the current working directory.
- `ls`: List the contents of the current directory.
- `createfile`: Create a new file in the current directory.
- `createdir`: Create a new directory in the current directory.
- `deletefile`: Delete a file in the current directory.
- `deletedir`: Delete a directory in the current directory.
- `rename`: Rename a file or directory in the current directory.
- `replace`: Replace the contents of a file in the current directory.
- `append`: Append contents to a file in the current directory.
- `write`: Write contents to a file in the current directory.

I built this CLI to help me learn Java and to practice my coding skills.
and also learn to use AI assistance more efficiently. But I did face a lot of
problems I faced while building it, so I decided to share it with you.
1. The proper use of NIO library was not clear to me.
2. String manipulation and using it in the right way was not clear to me.
3. Sometimes the AI was not able to understand the command, so I had to write
the command again. I'm spending more time to reduce AIs use and make my skills more
efficient.

I hope you find this useful and I will continue to improve it in the future.# Jakarta-CLI
